Learna Bootstrap :

```
 Lerna allows for installing and linking all the external/shared dependencies, also called bootstrapping, in the mono repo and creating symlinks to the shared dependency locations in the repo.
```

lerna run build --stream

lerna add --scope=@monorepo/ui -D html-webpack-plugin

TS  config :
Project References
Project references are a new feature in TypeScript 3.0 that allow you to structure your TypeScript programs into smaller pieces.

By doing this, you can greatly improve build times, enforce logical separation between components, and organize your code in new and better ways.

Weâ€™re also introducing a new mode for tsc, the --build flag, that works hand in hand with project references to enable faster TypeScript builds.
